# phaser-facebook-instant-games-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate to use to create Facebook Instant Games using Phaser.io

To develop on local, create a .env in the root directory of your app and add the following:
`VITE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`


To deploy to Facebook Instant Games, run `npm run build` and Vite will build the "dist" directory folder for you. Right click the directory and Zip it up (creating an archive file). Upload that archive file to Facebook Instant Games.
